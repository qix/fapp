# Fapp

I'm considering creating a new social network, or members club. I explicitly want it to be open to a larger community, but constrained in size.

(p.s. The name _probably_ needs work, but I don't hate it.)

## Membership

The goal is to create a tight community diverse people. About 20 to 30 at the start, maybe up to 100 later.

Some characteristics I'm looking for in members:  

**Nice**: Assumes best intent.

**Trustworthy**: Doesn't flake.

**Creative**: Make things.

**Tasteful**: Have opinions... good ones.

Members are expected to be active in the group, and host events if they can. In order to make room for new people inactive members may be removed.

## New members

Every member in the club needs to be vouched for by at least one other member.

Vouching for a new member declares confidence in your trust for the new person. If a club member betrays the trust of the group, both them and any members who vouched for them may be removed from the club.

I haven't decided on the exact process yet, but in order to constrain growth a vouch is _not enough_. Perhaps slots are opened up occassionally.

## Use cases

I've got a lot of hopes for this group, but among the immediate list:

**Short term plans:** Who wants to join for this show tonight? Anyone want to grab dinner?

**Long term plans:** Anyone interested in a ski trip in March?

**Group excursions**: I'll plan a trip to Cape Town (March 15-23) if atleast six (max twelve) of you are interested. Estimate $600-$800/head.

**Dinner parties**: I'm doing a Sunday lamb roast next week and have space for four people, who can commit? (See _trustworthy_ membership requirement)

**Reservation/tickets**: Anyone want to take my dinner reservation for next week? I can't make this show if anyone wants to buy the tickets?

**Travelling**: Find contacts in a city in the group, or friends of the group.

**Sublets**: I'm headed out of town, anyone trusted want to sublet my place?

## Sharing

I am hoping to this will spawn a diverse group of friends, but with diversity comes inequality. I would love to see a pay-it-forward approach to group activities.

If you can't afford to host a dinner, but want to, then sure â€“ set a attendance price. If you're comfortable covering it, then make it free. If you got a free dinner, and can afford it,  pay for another one in the future.

## Membership fee

**Free**, for now. Probably free later too... I'm not doing this to earn money.

That said, I'm aware some members could afford to pay something, and it would open up a lot more possibilities for what we could rent/purchase as a group.

## Software and website

The whole point of this is in-person interaction, **but** there are various places where useful tools can be built to facilitate that.

We'll take the _less is better_ approach, and use as many free services as possible. The website will facilitate integration between all the services.

Initially I expect it'll be built around a Discord chat server, Google Calendar, and a weekly email mailing list.

Everything will be open-source, and members are encouraged to improve the site, or anyone can spin off their own version of this club.
