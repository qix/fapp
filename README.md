## About

I am creating a new social members club. For more information check out the [Manifesto](website/public/MANIFESTO.md) first.

## Software and website

The whole point of this is in-person interaction, **but** there are various places where useful tools can be built to facilitate that.

We'll take the _less is better_ approach, and use as many free services as possible. The website will facilitate integration between all the services.

Initially I expect it'll be built around a Discord chat server, Google Calendar, and a weekly email mailing list.

Everything will be open-source, and members are encouraged to improve the site, or anyone can spin off their own version of this club.
